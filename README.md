A beginner-friendly attendance management system built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java. This system allows you to manage student attendance, generate reports, and track statistics.

## 🌟 Features

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- **Modern Responsive UI**: Beautiful, mobile-friendly interface
- **Dashboard**: Real-time statistics and recent activity
- **Student Management**: Add, view, and remove students
- **Attendance Marking**: Easy attendance marking by class and date
- **Reports Generation**: Individual, class, and overall statistics
- **Data Persistence**: Uses localStorage to save data in browser

### Backend (Java)
- **Student Class**: Represents student data with attendance tracking
- **AttendanceManager**: Core logic for managing attendance operations
- **AttendanceSystem**: Console interface for testing and administration
- **Data Persistence**: Serialization to save data to files

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Text editor or IDE (optional)

### Installation

1. **Download the Project**
   - Save all files in the same directory
   - Ensure you have: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, `Student.java`, `AttendanceManager.java`, `AttendanceSystem.java`

2. **Run the Frontend**
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser
   - The system will load with sample data for demonstration

3. **Run the Java Backend (Optional)**
   ```bash
   # Compile Java files
   javac *.java
   
   # Run the console application
   java AttendanceSystem
   ```

## 📖 How to Use

### Web Interface

1. **Dashboard Tab**
   - View overall statistics
   - See recent attendance activities
   - Monitor today's attendance percentage

2. **Students Tab**
   - Add new students with ID, name, email, and class
   - View all registered students
   - Remove students when needed

3. **Mark Attendance Tab**
   - Select a class and date
   - Mark students as present or absent
   - Use "Mark All Present/Absent" for quick marking

4. **Reports Tab**
   - Generate individual student reports
   - Create class-wise attendance reports
   - View overall statistics

### Java Console Interface

The Java console provides the same functionality through a command-line interface:

```
=== Main Menu ===
1. Add Student
2. View All Students
3. Mark Attendance
4. View Attendance
5. Generate Report
6. View Statistics
7. Search Students
8. Remove Student
0. Exit
```
