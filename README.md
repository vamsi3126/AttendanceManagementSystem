   - Project includes the following files:
     - `index.html` - Main application interface
     - `styles.css` - Styling and design
     - `script.js` - JavaScript functionality
     - `Student.java` - Student data model
     - `AttendanceManager.java` - Core attendance logic
     - `AttendanceSystem.java` - Console application
     - `compile_and_run.bat` - Compilation script
     - `README.md` - Documentation

2. **Run the Frontend**
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser
   - The system will load with sample data for demonstration

3. **Run the Java Backend (Optional)**
   ```bash
   # Compile Java files
   javac *.java
   
   # Run the console application
   java AttendanceSystem
   ```

## 📖 How to Use
